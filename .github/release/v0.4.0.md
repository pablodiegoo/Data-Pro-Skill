# Release Notes - v0.4.0

**Release Date**: 2026-02-24  
**Type**: Major Refactoring & Minor Release  
**Source**: OS18 (Sebrae Churn) Harvest + Core Architecture Split

## 🎯 Highlights

Data-Pro-Skill v0.4.0 delivers the most critical performance and reliability update to date: **The Monolith Split**. 
The overgrown `data-analysis-suite` (23+ scripts causing massive LLM context bloat and hallucination) has been surgically divided into 4 ultra-specialized, focused Agent skills. Concurrently, all non-global rigid Rules were stripped from the system prompt and deferred to on-demand References. 

By drastically reducing token load, the Agent now operates with surgical precision, deciding exactly which analytical skill to mount (e.g., Causal Inference vs. Simple Survey Crosstabs) without loading the entire universe of stats.

Additionally, this release integrates **OS18 (Sebrae)** learnings, delivering new scripts for client-facing statistical explainability and Qualtrics automation.

### 💎 Key Additions & Restructuring

#### 1. The Monolith Split (New Skills)
- **`survey-analytics`**: Core statistical processing (NPS, Top-Box, Crosstabs, Factor Analysis).
- **`strategic-frameworks`**: Executive matrices (Priority, Halo Removal, Pain Curves).
- **`causal-inference`**: Mathematical impact modeling (Driver Analysis, Chi2 Residuals).
- **`machine-learning-lite`**: Highly-interpretable ML (Permutation Feature Importance, SMOTE) explicitly constrained to prevent black-box deployments.

#### 2. Ingestion Track Fusion
- **`data-manipulation`**: Absorbed DuckDB capabilities point-blank. The agent now seamlessly decides between Pandas (small data/pivoting) and DuckDB (dirty headers, large datasets) in a single unified entry point.

#### 3. OS18 Process Harvesting
- **Relevance Explanation Generator**: Programmatically scaffolds notebooks that explain Chi-Square residuals visually to end-clients, replacing legacy BI metric black-boxes.
- **Qualtrics Pipeline Stripper**: Automatically detects and trims Qualtrics system metadata logic-blocks from header lines.
- **Methodological Upgrades**: Diverging Bar Charts and Survey Branching rules incorporated.
