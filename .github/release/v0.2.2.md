# Release Notes - v0.2.2

**Release Date**: 2026-02-23  
**Type**: Minor Release  
**Source**: Project Evolution from Festival Verão 2026

## 🎯 Highlights

Version 0.2.2 introduces a massive upgrade to our analytical workflow: **The Dual-Layered Notebook Generators**. Instead of writing boilerplate visualization code for every project, Data-Pro can now auto-generate comprehensive, presentation-ready Jupyter Notebooks for both basic Descriptive EDA and Advanced Analytics (Clustering, Drivers, Bias Removal).

### 💎 Key Additions

#### New Capabilities
- **Automated Notebook Generators**: Located in `data-analysis-suite`.
  - `eda_notebook_generator.py`: Auto-detects data types and builds complete descriptive notebooks.
  - `advanced_analytics_generator.py`: Executes end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines (Random Forests, PCA, K-Means + DBSCAN) directly into a notebook.
- **Dual Clustering & The Pure Sentiment Stack**: New advanced statistical methodologies documented for extracting true bias-free sentiment and identifying respondent anomalies.

#### Enhanced Skills
- **`data-analysis-suite`**: Absorbed 3 new master scripts (`eda_notebook_generator.py`, `advanced_analytics_generator.py`, `qualitative_categorizer.py`) and a new `new_methodologies.md` reference guide.
- **`duckdb-sql-master`**: Enhanced with `duckdb_fuzzy_cleaner.py` to seamlessly ingest and map extremely messy CSV files.

#### Database Enhancements
- **New Snippets**: DuckDB fuzzy mapping & Chi-Squared Residual heatmaps.
- **New Analysis Types**: Registered the notebook generators and Halo Effect removal as core system capabilities.
