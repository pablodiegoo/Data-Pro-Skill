# Causal Inference

This skill utilizes mathematical modeling to go beyond correlation, identifying what genuinely moves the needle.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Driver & Association Analysis
- **`drivers_analysis.py`**: Identifies key drivers of a target variable (e.g., Overall Satisfaction).
- **`association_matrix.py`**: Calculates strong associations between categorical groups.
- **`chi2_residuals.py`**: Computes standard and adjusted residuals for cross-tabulations.

### 2. Modeling Diagnostics
- **`partial_residual_plot.py`** & **`glm_partial_residual_plot.py`**: Validates linear and generalized linear models.
- **`factor_analysis.py`**: Discovers latent variables and structure in complex data.
- **`multivariate_normal_contours.py`**: Plots multidimensional relationships.
