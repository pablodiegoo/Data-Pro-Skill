# Strategic Frameworks

This skill focuses on delivering high-level, actionable business insights rather than raw statistical metrics.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Prioritization & Sentiment
- **`priority_matrix.py`**: Generates a 2x2 matrix plotting Importance vs. Satisfaction/Performance.
- **`pain_curves.py`**: Actionable visualization charting dissatisfaction points across cohorts.
- **`halo_removal.py`**: Adjusts survey ratings to remove brand/halo bias.
- **`disapproval_analysis.py`**: Deep dive into negative sentiment drivers.

### 2. Flow & Evaluation
- **`conversion_funnel.py`**: Calculates and plots multi-stage funnels (e.g., Awareness -> Conversion).
- **`ipsative_analysis.py`**: Normalizes variables within respondents to find relative intra-personal preference.
