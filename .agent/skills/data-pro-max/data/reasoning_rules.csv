r017,visualization,has_negative_values,Avoid pie charts and stacked areas,use bar chart or waterfall instead,high,general,Pie/stacked area cannot represent negative values correctly
r018,visualization,n_categories > 10,Consider grouping or using horizontal bar chart,group into Other or use alternative viz,medium,general,Too many categories create visual clutter
r019,visualization,comparing_distributions,Use box plots or violin plots instead of bar charts,switch to distribution-focused visualization,medium,general,Bar charts hide distribution shape and outliers
r020,visualization,showing_change,Consider using slope chart or bump chart,apply appropriate change visualization,medium,general,Standard charts may not emphasize change effectively
r021,report_type,is_executive,Lead with key findings and recommendations,structure report with executive summary first,high,general,Executives have limited time - lead with conclusions
r022,report_type,is_technical,Include methodology and statistical details,add appendix with full statistical output,high,research,Technical audiences need reproducibility details
r023,segmentation,goal_is_personas,Use K-Means or Hierarchical clustering on behavioral variables,apply clustering after dimensionality reduction,high,marketing,Personas require grouping similar respondents
r024,segmentation,n_clusters_unknown,Use elbow method or silhouette score to determine K,calculate metrics for K=2 to K=10,high,marketing,Optimal K should be determined empirically
r025,text_analysis,has_open_ended,Apply word frequency and sentiment analysis first,run basic NLP before advanced techniques,medium,survey,Start with simple text metrics before complex analysis
r026,time_series,has_datetime_index,Check for seasonality and trend before modeling,decompose time series first,high,financial,Understanding components improves forecasting
r027,time_series,forecasting_needed,Use ARIMA or Prophet for univariate forecasting,fit appropriate time series model,high,financial,Proper time series models capture autocorrelation
r028,weighting,is_survey_data,Check if sample weighting is needed to match population,compare sample demographics to targets,high,survey,Unweighted surveys may not represent population

r031,multiple_testing,n_tests > 5,Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction,adjust alpha or use FDR method,high,research,Multiple comparisons inflate false positive rate
r032,assumption_check,using_regression,Check residual normality and homoscedasticity,plot residuals and run diagnostic tests,high,research,Violated assumptions invalidate inference
r033,data_quality,has_duplicates,Remove or investigate duplicate records,check for true duplicates vs valid repeats,critical,general,Duplicates can inflate sample size artificially
