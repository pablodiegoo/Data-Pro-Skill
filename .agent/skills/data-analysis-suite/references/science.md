Advanced techniques for Marketing Science and Political Campaigning to reveal true sentiment and retention.

## 2. Political Analysis (Crisis & Retention)
Metrics for campaign and public safety monitoring.
- **Pain Curve Analysis** (`scripts/pain_curves.py`): Identifies sentiment thresholds where disapproval becomes critical.
- **Disapproval Deep-Dive** (`scripts/disapproval_analysis.py`): Breaks down negative sentiment drivers.
