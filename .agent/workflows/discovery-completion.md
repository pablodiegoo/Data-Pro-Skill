# Discovery Completion Workflow

This is the final stage of the discovery phase.

## Step 1: Generate Project Brief
Create `project-brief.md` in the root with:
- Business Objective
- Scope & Key Questions
- Data Source Inventory
- Technical Strategy (Mapping requirements to specific skills)

## Step 2: Initialize Task Board
Create or update `task.md` with the first set of concrete implementation tasks based on the Brief.

## Step 3: User Handoff
Notify the user that Discovery is complete and present the `project-brief.md` for approval.
