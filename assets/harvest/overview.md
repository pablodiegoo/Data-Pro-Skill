# Project Harvest Overview

**Project**: Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (Python & R)  
**Repository**: gedeck/practical-statistics-for-data-scientists  
**Harvest Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Status**: Complete - Cycle 2 (Final)

## Project Summary

This is an educational repository containing code examples for the O'Reilly book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python" (2nd Edition, 2020). The repository provides parallel implementations in both Python and R across 7 chapters covering exploratory data analysis, significance testing, regression, classification, machine learning, and unsupervised learning.

## Harvest Progress

### Cycle 1 (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 1 - Scripts Scan**: 4 reusable utilities extracted (correlation plotting, partial residuals, permutation tests, path finder).
- **Phase 2 - Methodology & Patterns Scan**: Documented 5 educational visualization patterns.
- **Phase 3 - Data & Database Scan**: 6 snippets, 5 analysis types, and 8 rules proposed for `datapro`.
- **Phase 4 - Documentation & Governance Scan**: Created standard for educational code clarity.
- **Phase 5 - Architecture & Organization Scan**: Documented dual-language and chapter-based repository patterns.
- **Count**: 24 items identified.

### Cycle 2 (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 1 - Scripts Scan**: 3 new utilities (PCA, Gower, Contours).
- **Phase 2 - Methodology & Patterns Scan**: 2 new analytical references (ML diagnostics, Advanced clustering).
- **Phase 3 - Data & Database Scan**: snippets for unsupervised learning in `new_snippets_cycle2.json`.
- **Phase 4 - Documentation & Governance Scan**: Verified against Cycle 1 standards.
- **Phase 5 - Architecture & Organization Scan**: Verified against Cycle 1 patterns.
- **Count**: 32 total items (+8 in Cycle 2).

## Notes

This is a **textbook code repository** focused on education rather than production analytics. The harvest will focus on:
- Reusable visualization patterns
- Statistical method implementations
- Data exploration utilities
- Educational reference materials

Given the educational nature, many scripts are intentionally simple demonstrations rather than production-ready tools.
