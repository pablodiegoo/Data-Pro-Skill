# Data Pro Max - Data Analysis Intelligence

An AI orchestrator that provides **intelligent recommendations** for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. It automatically activates for data-intensive tasks and coordinates specialized sub-skills.

## 1. Integrated Skill Cores

Data Pro Max coordinates these 4 specialized consolidated skills:

| Core Skill | Functionality | Primary Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`data-analysis-suite`** | All Stats, Causal & Science | Survey weighting, drivers, halo effects, pipeline automation. |
| **`geoprocessing-brazil`** | Geo-spatial & Mapping | City normalization, Brazil choropleth maps. |
| **`data-viz`** | Statistical Visualization | Professional charts, evolution plots, word clouds. |
| **`reporting-mastery`** | Technical Documentation | Premium reports, Mermaid diagrams, GitHub-style docs. |

## 2. Master Workflows (Slash Commands)

| Command | Workflow | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/project-onboarding`** | Initial setup & rules | Mandatory for every new project startup. |
| **`/survey-analysis-pipeline`**| End-to-end execution | From data prep to final automated report. |
| **`/knowledge-management`** | Skill evolution | Harvesting from staging or project retrospectives. |
| **`/document-study`** | Research tool | Deep analysis of papers, articles, or methodology. |

## 3. High-Performance Workflow

    D & E --> F[data-viz]
    F --> G[reporting-mastery]
    G --> H[Final Report]
```

## 4. Operational Best Practices

### Step 1: Integrated Analysis
Use `data-analysis-suite` for any quantitative task. Consult the `references/*.md` inside that skill for specific methodologies (e.g., `causal.md` for drivers).

### Step 2: Consistent Aesthetics
Always use `data-viz` for chart generation to ensure Sebrae-compatible styling and 300 DPI quality.

### Step 3: Global Language Policy
All technical artifacts, code comments, and documentation produced MUST be written in **English**.
